He wondered if there was any relationship between the average number of hours doing homework per week and score in a standardized exam. Fortunately, he knew that a school counseling office has this data set from students from previous year. So he got data from them and plotted average number of hours doing homework per week on the x-axis and the score in the entrance exam on the y-axis.  "
